# Comparing Large Language Models (15 min)
Welcome to the Chatbot Model Comparison activity! Here, you will compare the output of three different chatbot models. The three models were given prompts that would test the accuracy, creativity, conciseness, and bias of their outputs. Your job is to select the model that performed best in each category. Let's get started!

Complete the activity [here](https://igfnaqfcyl-13589482-i.codehs.me/index.html).  Then edit this page and write down your reflections here:

### Which model did you find performed best overall, and why?
Overall model B performed the best because it gave the best answers while also provided enough additional information instead of going off topic like model C.

### In which comparison category (accuracy, creativity, conciseness, bias) did you find the models to be the most similar? What about the most different?
i found them most similar in the creativity category especially since model a and b both had very similar names. The section i found most different was the conciseness because they each gave different types of responses with model c giving too much and model a giving too little.

### Were you surprised by any of the results?
i was suprised by how much model c went off topic

### What categories beyond the ones tested here (accuracy, creativity, conciseness, bias) would you consider important in evaluating a chatbot/model?
i think originallity would also be important because ai often plagerizes or gives the same responses.
